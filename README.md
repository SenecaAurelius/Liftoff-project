# README

This branch is designed to be an archival record of the Treasure Task project as we worked on it through our LiftOff unit for LaunchCode Web Development JavaScript & Java course. As I (Darren) and others continue working on it, I wanted to "freeze" the code so that if you ever need to demo features for interviews, you can pull up the project as it was when we graduated LaunchCode in August.

To launch the project, clone this repository onto your local machine. Set up a new Schema in MYSQL that has the correct properties (you can find them in the application.properties file in src/main/resources)

Running build.gradle should start the localhost, and you can launch the project in your browser at localhost:8080.
