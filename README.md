# README

Hi all! The code base should be up and running. When you pull the repo onto your local machine, be sure to set up a new Schema in MYSQL that has the correct properies (you can find them in the  application.properties file in src/main/resources)

I added github's recommended .gitignore files for Gradle projects (I think this is meant to prevent you from constantly committing/versioning default Gradle files that don't matter), but if anyone has any trouble with it we can try to remove it (especially since I hadn't messed with a gitignore previously).
